# markdown.is

markdown.is is a simple website that fetches markdown files from github and renders them as html.

The initial motivation for this was to be able to view a Github Profile page a standalone website,
without taking the visitor to Github. e.g. [markdown.is/gh/gtalarico](https://markdown.is/gh/gtalarico)
renders [github.com/gtalarico/gtalarico/README.md](https://github.com/gtalarico/gtalarico/README.md).

You can read more about it [here](https://markdown.is/docs).
